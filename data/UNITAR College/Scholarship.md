## The Social Security Organisation Education Fund (SOCSO)
The Social Security Organization (SOCSO) provides social security protection through social insurance, including medical and cash benefits, provision of artificial aids and rehabilitation to employees to reduce suffering and to provide financial guarantee and protection to the family. It is commonly known in Bahasa Malaysia as PERKESO or Pertubuhan Keselamatan Sosial.

One of the benefits which SOCSO provides for Malaysians is the education benefit, which comes in the form of a loan. Although this benefit is in the form of a loan, it can, however, be converted into a scholarship if the child obtains excellent results. This fund is for the benefit of SOCSO members / contributors in the form of a loan given to dependent children who are in receipt of a monthly benefit for:

- Dependent’s Benefit
- Survivor’s Pension or children of an employee who are in receipt of a monthly benefit for Permanent Disablement or Invalidity Pension.

**Eligibility**
Applicants must be dependent children of employees who are contributors to the SOCSO insurance schemes, receiving Invalidity Pension or those receiving periodic or permanent disablement payouts. Applicants can also be children of contributors who died while in employment because of injuries, or died before reaching 55 years of age. The applicants must be below 21 years of age, unmarried at the time of application and pursuing degree, diploma or certificate courses recognized by the Education Ministry. This loan is given to deserving students who have done well in their examinations and are admitted to institutes of higher learning.

The following persons are not eligible for the loan:

- Siblings of the insured
- Matriculation/foundation/scholarship students.

**Loan coverage**
SOCSO is offering educational loans, amounting to as much as RM100,000, to children of members who are in receipt of monthly invalidity pensions.

The borrower is required to repay the loan via monthly installments once the person has completed the study programme.

**How to apply**
Application has to be made by completing the “Permohonan Pinjaman Pendidikan PERKESO” form available at the local SOCSO office. You can also visit www.perkeso.gov.my for more information.
