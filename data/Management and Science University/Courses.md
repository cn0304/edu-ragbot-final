### About

About the Course The liberal arts and sciences have been the foundation of college education for centuries, and are more important and useful today than ever before. Rather than a narrow program with a single focus, a liberal arts and sciences education includes lots of possible subjects and areas of study. Students can explore and study the arts, humanities, social sciences, languages, management, computers, and music. They will be exposed to the ideas and cultures of people from across the world, from ancient times to today. They can also combine their interests and talents into an education unique to them. The liberal arts programme at MSU teaches what today’s employers say they value most: communication of ideas, as well as the ability to find and analyze information and data, adapt to new technology and professional trends, work with others to solve problems, and make confident, knowledgeable decisions. The education does more than teach the student, as the skills they gain for a successful career will in turn provide them with the experiences and understanding they need for a fulfilling life.
