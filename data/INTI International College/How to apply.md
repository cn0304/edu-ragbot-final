### Step 3

Prepare for your International Study

**Step 1:** Obtain Student Visa Approval Letter

Upon obtaining your Student Visa Approval Letter issued by Malaysia’s Immigration Office, you are required to pay an advanced tuition fee (equivalent to the 1st semester tuition fee and other miscellaneous fees), as a “Prepaid Fee” to secure your enrolment, before the original Visa Approval Letter is sent to you.

For students who only require a Single Entry Visa, kindly bring the original Visa Approval Letter together with your passport to the nearest Malaysian Embassy/Consulate as you are required to obtain a single entry permit before entering Malaysia. For certain nationalities, the Single-Entry Visa can be obtained through eVisa.

**Step 2:** Inform INTI of Your Scheduled Arrival

Contact the respective campus at least 5 (five) working days prior to your arrival in Malaysia to arrange for airport pick-up.

Respective campus representative will acknowledge receipt of your airport pick-up request and provide the name and contact details of the International Office officer who will be meeting you at the airport.

**Step 3:** Bring Relevant Documents

Remember to bring along these documents before arriving:

- Original Passport with validity of at least 12 months
- Original High school certificates and transcripts
- Original copy of Visa Approval Letter and Single Entry Visa
- Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate (for African nationalities)

**Step 4:** Prepare for Your Arrival in Malaysia

Fill up the **Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC)** online within 3 days prior to your scheduled arrival in Malaysia. If you do not belong to any of the MDAC-exempted nationals or categories, it is mandatory for you to submit the MDAC.
