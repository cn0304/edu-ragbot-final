### Additional information

Biotechnology
Biotechnology is a field of applied biology which uses living organisms, such as plants, animals and micro-organisms to make or modify products or processes for a specific use. Some of its more commonly known terms are genetic engineering, artificial selection and hybridization. Biotechnology is widely used in medicine, engineering and agriculture fields to bring about improvements in food and medicines, treatments for diseases and even waste removal. There is also the emergence of “Industrial Biotechnology” with a growing market of products using bio-based materials and production techniques in industrial applications. Companies such as Toyota, Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, DuPont and Cargill are in various R&D stages, all vying to be ahead in this new branch of technology.
Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics derives knowledge from computer analysis of biological data. It is highly interdisciplinary, using techniques and concepts from informatics, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics and linguistics. Thanks to massive yearly funding, America is the best place to obtain a degree in this study.
Biochemistry
Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at cellular and molecular levels. You will study the mechanisms of brain function, cellular multiplication and differentiation, communication within and between cells and organs, and the chemical bases of inheritance and disease.
Microbiology
Microbiology has a major impact on virtually all other scientific disciplines. You will learn about bacterial genetics, anatomy and reproduction. Instructions will also cover topics such as cell biology, microbial genetics and laboratory methods.
Molecular Biology
Molecular Biology is the basic science that seeks an understanding of life processes, the properties and functions of molecules that make up living cells, and how biomolecules operate and interact to drive the complex and diverse behaviours of living systems. The scope ranges from evolution and development to the regulation of gene expression.
Biomedical Science
Biomedical Science is the study of health and assessing and analyzing methods of treating disease. This major is suitable for students with a strong interest in biology and chemistry as well as an interest in the development of medical issues, either in research, health monitoring or treatment of a disease.
You are also required to take a specific number of Soft Skills and Communicative Foreign Language programs as a part of your degree.

Medical Technology involves the study of micro-organisms through the examination of body fluids, tissues, cells, chemical content of fluids, and blood samples.
Neuroscience
This study is a multidisciplinary field that includes psychology, computer science, statistical physics and medicine in the scientific study of the nervous system and its components and functional activities at the molecular, cellular, system, behavioural, and cognitive levels.
Food Science And Nutrition
Nutritional Science is the multidisciplinary study of food and the application of knowledge to the development of food products and processes, the preservation and storage of foods, the assurance of food safety and quality and its effect on metabolism, health, performance and disease resistance of humans and animals, including the study of human behaviours related to foods.
Dietetics
This study involves the planning of food and nutrition, supervising the preparation and serving of meals and also helps prevent and treat illnesses by promoting healthy eating habits, scientifically evaluating clients’ diets and suggesting diet medications.
Nursing
This study focuses on practical applications of nursing that expands into the theoretical realms of patient care.
Nanotechnology
This study is the development of new devices, materials and structures that are well below the 1-micron size scale. The study explores the possibilities of detecting molecules of chemical warfare agents, creating a new generation of computer components or making medical strides on the molecular level.
Astrophysics
This study focuses on the theoretical and observational study of the structure, properties, and behaviour of stars, star systems and clusters, stellar life cycles, and related phenomena. Astrophysicists interpret observational data with laws of physics and mathematics and include areas in cosmology, plasma kinetics, stellar physics, convolution and non-equilibrium radiation transfer theory, non-Euclidean geometries, mathematical modelling, galactic structure theory, and relativistic astronomy.
Forensics
This interdisciplinary study draws from chemistry, biology, agriculture, physics, psychology, and law to apply techniques and principles of the natural and physical sciences to the analysis of evidence collected during criminal investigations. Students learn to perform tests on substances like glass, fibre, tissue, hair and body fluids.
