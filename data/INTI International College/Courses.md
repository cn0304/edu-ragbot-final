### Additional information

Fields of study available
Computer Science
Computer Science spans a wide range, from theoretical and algorithmic foundations to cutting-edge developments. Computer Science offers a comprehensive foundation that permits graduates to adapt to new technologies and ideas.
As such smart devices have dominated the landscape of computing since the last few years. With more and more smart devices thatbehave like a mini computer in the markets nowadays, in keeping up with the demand for their applications, many software houses are looking towards building APPs. It will fulfill the current market demand for these specialised APP programmers.
Mobile Computing
This field of study will help students understand how basic computer networks and mobile applications work, as well as the technology behind wired and wireless networks. Skills developed include computer network design, correcting network problems, network security preventions, network management techniques and mobile programming for smart phones.
Network and Security
Companies are spending a lot of resources to protect their data and networks. This specialisation will enable students to protect network systems from theft, hacker attacks and breaches in network security.
Software Development
Students will learn to design, implement and document quality software systems in appropriate languages for available computers. This includes the ability to design software that makes effective use of the hardware. They will also gain a clear understanding of organisational structures, along with the information needs and consequent systems requirements of an organisation.
Business Analytics
Business Analytics is the process of converting data into insights. With the increase in the availability of data, Analytics has now become a major differentiator in both the top line and the bottom line of any organisation. The specialisation in Business Analytics teaches the use of data and models to support decision making in business. Students learn how to model such relationships as the impact of advertising on sales, how historical data predict stock returns, and how changes in task characteristics can influence time to completion. This programme helps prepare students for careers in “economy of tomorrow” industries. They play a vital role in their organisations’ technological direction. In an IT end-user industry, Business Analytics and Optimisation (BAO) responsibilities can reside in various corporate functions and departments, such as operations, product development, information ystems and finance.
For IT consulting/services and IT products organisations, the BAO consultants lead large-scale data warehousing and business intelligence projects, advising large clients the world over in reshaping their businesses.
Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is one of the most exciting areas in IT today. Cloud computing is used by many businesses whose employees and customers are able to access their data with a myriad of Internet-connected devices. Therefore, these businesses do not have to build and run their own data centres, which can be very costly. The Cloud Computing and Virtualization specialisation prepares students to understand the emerging technologies of cloud computing and virtualization, their principles, modelling, analysis, design, deployment and industry-oriented applications. Major solution architectures and enabling technologies are covered.
The Cloud Computing programme prepares students to understand the:
• Emerging technologies of Cloud Computing and Virtualization
• Principles, modeling, analysis, design, deployment, and industry-oriented applications
• Major solution architectures and enabling technologies
• Development of applications and services

### Additional information

Biotechnology
Biotechnology is a field of applied biology which uses living organisms, such as plants, animals and micro-organisms to make or modify products or processes for a specific use. Some of its more commonly known terms are genetic engineering, artificial selection and hybridization. Biotechnology is widely used in medicine, engineering and agriculture fields to bring about improvements in food and medicines, treatments for diseases and even waste removal. There is also the emergence of “Industrial Biotechnology” with a growing market of products using bio-based materials and production techniques in industrial applications. Companies such as Toyota, Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, DuPont and Cargill are in various R&D stages, all vying to be ahead in this new branch of technology.
Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics derives knowledge from computer analysis of biological data. It is highly interdisciplinary, using techniques and concepts from informatics, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics and linguistics. Thanks to massive yearly funding, America is the best place to obtain a degree in this study.
Biochemistry
Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at cellular and molecular levels. You will study the mechanisms of brain function, cellular multiplication and differentiation, communication within and between cells and organs, and the chemical bases of inheritance and disease.
Microbiology
Microbiology has a major impact on virtually all other scientific disciplines. You will learn about bacterial genetics, anatomy and reproduction. Instructions will also cover topics such as cell biology, microbial genetics and laboratory methods.
Molecular Biology
Molecular Biology is the basic science that seeks an understanding of life processes, the properties and functions of molecules that make up living cells, and how biomolecules operate and interact to drive the complex and diverse behaviours of living systems. The scope ranges from evolution and development to the regulation of gene expression.
Biomedical Science
Biomedical Science is the study of health and assessing and analyzing methods of treating disease. This major is suitable for students with a strong interest in biology and chemistry as well as an interest in the development of medical issues, either in research, health monitoring or treatment of a disease.
You are also required to take a specific number of Soft Skills and Communicative Foreign Language programs as a part of your degree.

Denise Moura Madeira, Universidade Federal de Lavras, Brazil
This preparatory course and language classes online exceeded my expectations giving me the overall idea about IELTS, and I could get effective knowledge, guidance, and practice. For example, it helped me prepare for all modules - Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking - in the IELTS test. Besides that, the lecturer (Jonathan) has a didactic approach to teaching.
Hanh Duc Nguyen, An Giang University, Vietnam
When taking this course, I realized that I could ask my mentor in the Friday class session. Through the videos, I can learn new vocabulary, pronunciation, English skills. During this course, the thing I learned most was how to write an essay to describe a chart or a graph. What I liked best was the Friday session because I could talk to my instructor, Mr. Jonathan, who was very friendly, kind, and helpful, and I could speak to different friends from different countries in the world.
Hien Vo Nguyen Thuy, Nha Trang University, Vietnam
I really love this course because I have practiced speaking more, and I can use those words which Mr. Jonathan shared with me about my life in Vietnam. I also improved my English skills, my mom said that she was proud of me. I learned more information when I joined a class with foreign people.

I did learn a lot of things and this IELTS training course gave us many benefits. The reading section was tough but during this course I learnt and know how to match headings, how to fill the blanks and what is the main thing for reading. The very first thing which I learnt during this course was speaking with the teacher and colleagues, asking questions about IELTS test and getting super answers from the teacher. The best thing about this course was meeting on Friday, communicating with the teacher and friends and talking about some main point and topics.
Theofilus Jose Setiawan, Universitas Kristen Indonesia, Indonesia
I am extremely happy to be able to take this course because I can now know and learn more about the things I have to face in the IELTS exam. At first, I was worried about the IELTS. However, because of Mr Jonathan who always teaches well, who always communicates, who always corrects what's wrong, who always gives input, and who always supports his students, the obstacles that I imagined about the IELTS exam are getting less and less. The videos include reading, listening, and other exercises, still attract my attention because of Mr Jonathan's teaching. For Mr Jonathan, you are my role model in teaching.
Túlio Passos Lopes, Universidade Federal de Lavras, Brazil
I was very excited with the course. Just by getting in contact with Jonathan through the emails and speaking with my practice partner I think I have learned a lot. Also, the chance of speaking with people from different nations is unique, and it not only improves the idiom, but it additionally contributes to culture.
Yao Jiawen, Wenzhou Medical University, China
The course plays an important role in communicating more fluently and confidently with others. When I took the class, the teacher encouraged us to share our views and expand our minds. The accent is so standard and clear, it could be an enjoyable feeling for me to listen to. I am addicted to his teaching methods.
Zhao Yimin, Wenzhou Medical University, China
Thanks a lot for these high-quality courses, the teacher is very nice and ready to help us. I learned a lot from it.

## intensive-english-programme-iep

### Programme Structure

The INTENSIVE ENGLISH PROGRAMME integrates language assessment at all stages of the programme. The assessment component comprises a mid-session test, coursework, class participation and a final exam. Throughout the programme, experienced and trained teachers continuously measure the level of students, monitor progress and provide crucial student feedback for focused linguistic development.
IEP 101:
This lower elementary course focuses on getting the fundamentals of English. Focusing heavily on basic accuracy, students develop a solid foundation to build on. Our task-based learning approach ensures meaningful use of English with plenty of opportunities to practice all four skills.
IEP 102:
Building on the solid foundations of IEP 101, IEP 102 encourages more complex language skills for students to experiment with. Using a task-based approach, meaningful interaction is put at the forefront of the classroom experience. At the end of this level, students are expected to be able to confidently give simple descriptions of very familiar topics such as people, places, working and living conditions, likes and dislikes, etc.
IEP 103:
Moving towards the A2+ to B1 level, IEP 103 encourages students to work on their accuracy as well as increasing their vocabulary. Tasks are also fully used to give the students meaningful practice of English for more specific purposes. Once students have completed this level, their confidence in communicating straightforward ideas on a variety of familiar subjects will be in full development.
IEP 104:
Starting this level at B1, students are officially at the intermediate level and are ready to focus more specifically on IELTS level materials. In this course, students will not only increase their vocabulary, but they will also learn the basics of how to approach and be successful in IELTS tests. Covering all 4 skills, by the end of this level, students can begin to think about achieving an IELTS 5.0.
IEP 105:
Students who are B1+ to B2- will get the most out of this course. A more detailed focus on IELTS skills ensures that students who progress through this level will begin to feel confident in achieving at least an IELTS 5.0 to 5.5.
IEP 106:
The final level in IEP is our 106 course. This is for upper-intermediate B2 to B2+ students. The most challenging of all our levels, successful students can expect to become fully familiar with the IELTS test. Our students who progress through this level can expect to achieve a 5.5 – 6.0 on the IELTS.
