## How to Apply
### Planning to Study Internationally?

### **Step 1: Sorting Out Your Visa Application**

Before you can begin your studies, you’ll need to secure a New Student Visa and a Visa Approval Letter (VAL). Here’s a simple guide to help you through the process.

**What You Need to Do**

**1\. Make Your Visa Payment:**  
Pay RM 4,600 for your student visa at least ***2 months*** before your course starts.  
*(For example, if your course begins in September, ensure payment is made by July.)*

**2\. Submit Your Visa Documents:**  
After making your visa payment, provide the following documents:

*   **A recent photograph** (35mm x 45mm) on a white background.
*   **A copy of your passport** showing your passport data page (recommended validity: 12 months), all pages with visa information\*, observation page (for any extensions, name clarifications, or previous passport numbers) and special pass or exit stamp (if applicable).
*   **Letter of acceptance** from your educational institution (we’ll provide this!).
*   **Copies of your academic certificates and transcripts.**
*   **Health Declaration Form.**
*   **Personal Bond Form** (signed to confirm adherence to Malaysian immigration laws).
*   **Payment receipts for** EMGS visa processing fees, immigration fees (if applicable), medical screening, medical insurance (if purchased through EMGS), courier fee (for your VAL, if needed) and iKad fee of RM 50 (+ RM 10 for courier delivery, if applicable).

**3\. Get Vaccinated**: Ensure you are fully vaccinated (all vaccine types are accepted) before travelling to Malaysia.

And that’s it! You’re all set with your visa preparation.

**Important Notes:**  
\* Use no more than **two passport pages per A4 sheet** when making copies.  
\* Applicants from Libya, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen must provide copies of **all passport pages.**

### **Step 2: Leave It to Us**

Once you’ve submitted your documents, the **International Student Office (ISO)** will take care of the rest.

**1\. Processing Your Student Visa Application:** We’ll prepare your application via STARS (Education Malaysia Global Services), issue your offer letter, and generate your invoice once your documents are received.

**2\. Submitting Your Documents to EMGS:** We’ll submit your documents to EMGS for approval after completing the online application.

**3\. Processing Your VAL:** Once your application is approved, we’ll email your VAL and confirm your entry into Malaysia.\* This process typically takes **14 working days**.

**Important Notes:**  
**\* Your VAL and Travel Authorisation will allow you to enter Malaysia.**

### **If Your Visa Application is Rejected**

In the unlikely event your application is rejected:

-   The ISO will notify you immediately.
-   We’ll appeal to EMGS if possible (depending on the reason for rejection).
-   If applicable, we’ll begin the refund process for your fees.
